### dependencypath-maven-plugin (avaliable from the Maven central repository) ###

Sets a property pointing to the artifact file for each selected project dependency. Each property name will have a base name in form of groupId:artifactId:type:[classifier][.relative][.suffix]. This is similar to the dependency:properties goal but with additional features, like setting a relative path and filtering.
